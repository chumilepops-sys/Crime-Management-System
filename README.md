- SQL database integration for persistent storage
- User-friendly interface (console/GUI)
- Input validation and basic error handling

 Tools & Technologies
 - Java
- NetBeans IDE
- SQL Database (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

Skills Demonstrated
- Database design and integration
- Java programming and object-oriented principles
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
- Handling user input and validation
- Understanding of CRUD operations and data management
